"Project Voyager: A Line Following Bot Navigating Black Arena to Detect and Follow White Lines"

#Description
JUST EXPERIENCE OF 2months long project.. ..

Hey there! We're thrilled to share our awesome experience at the 'Battle for Speed' event organized by the Robotics Club at Pashimanchal Campus, Pokhara. 
Our project, known as Project Voyager, stole the spotlight in this exciting competition.

Imagine a small robot that can follow a white line in a black arena all by itself! That's what our Project Voyager does.
It's like a tiny smart explorer. So, at the 'Battle for Speed' event, different teams brought their cool robots to race on a track with a tricky white line.

Guess what? Our Project Voyager performed amazingly well! It zoomed through the track, following the white line like a pro. Our hard work in making the bot smart and fast paid off big time.

And that's not all! The event was full of fun and learning. We met awesome people from other teams who had made their own fantastic robots. 
We got to exchange ideas and see how different robots worked. It was like a big playground of smart machines!

As a bonus, there were some cool gifts and prizes. Our Project Voyager's victory got us a shiny trophy and some happy cheers from everyone. 
It felt super great to win and share the joy with our team.

We're really proud of our little robot and the teamwork that made it all happen. Stay tuned for more exciting adventures as we keep tinkering, learning,
and having a blast in the world of robotics. Big thanks to the Robotics Club for organizing this awesome event. Until next time, keep on exploring and having fun with robots!"
