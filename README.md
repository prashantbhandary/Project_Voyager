"Project Voyager: A Line Following Bot Navigating Black Arena to Detect and Follow White Lines"

#Description

Welcome to Project Voyager, a remarkable line-following bot designed to conquer the challenge of 
traversing a black arena while adeptly detecting and tracking white lines. With cutting-edge sensing
capabilities and intelligent algorithms, this project showcases the bot's ability to autonomously journey
through the arena until it successfully detects and begins following the white line. Join us in exploring
the fascinating intersection of robotics, computer vision, and autonomous navigation as we unveil the capabilities
of Project Voyager. Follow our repository to stay updated on our progress, codebase, and insights gained from
this exciting endeavor. Let's navigate the path ahead, one line at a time!
